# How to organize the information on Astah for exporting the SEON Specification.

The SEON Model is the root package. It must have exact three direct subpackages typed 'Level' (Tagged Value: Type=Level), with part of the name "Foundational", "Core" and "Domain". Other subpackages are allowed.
The levels can be decomposed many times into packages typed 'Package', 'Ontology' or 'Subontology'. The only restriction is that an Ontology or a Subontology can not contain Ontologies. E.g. Root->Level->Ontology->Package->Subontology is valid.
The Packages (including Ontologies) can be optionaly ordered by using the tagged value 'Order' with a number. It will be used any time a sequence of packages is shown (e.g. ontologies in menu, packages and subontologies in sections).
The Ontologies should have, besides the type, the tagged values FullName (free text) and ShortName (free text). For each Ontology (inside the one of the three levels), will be generated a page, a menu link, and a node in the graph.
The Diagrams should define their types: 'CM' (conceptual model), 'Package' (package diagram), 'Other' (for informative diagrams) or 'Ignore' (to be skipped by the parser). If not defined, the default value is 'CM'.
The Dependency relations between two Ontologies shoud have a Definition text explaining the how the source Ontology depends on the target Ontology, and the dependency 'Level' defined as 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low'.
Any element can have information on the Definition field. For classes (concepts), after the text, can be added an example line preceeded by "@Ex.:".

Required Information on the Astah file:
  * Package (Tagged Value):    Type {'Level', 'Package', 'Ontology', 'Subontology', 'Ignore'} (default is 'Package').
  * Package (Tagged Value):    Order {1-N} (optional).
  * Ontology (Tagged Value):   Type {'Ontology'}; FullName {free text}; ShortName {free text}.
  * Diagram (Tagged Value):    Type {'CM', 'Package', 'Other', 'Ignore'} (default is 'CM').
  * Dependency (Tagged Value): Level {'High', 'Medium', 'Low'}.
  * All Elements (Definition): Free text.
  * Class (Definition):        After the definition text, optional example line preceeded by "@Ex.:".

Recommentations for the Astah file:
- Try to keep the diagrams not too large (max width size to fit in the page is 1000px)
- Try to avoid hidden relations and classes (delete with Ctrl+D)
- Pay attention to the relations' source and target. Put them in the correct direction, avoid name reverse direction.
- Pay attention to the relations' source and target. By an astah convention, a relation belongs to the same package of its source class. [Trick] If you have a relation that should belong to the actual package, but it has an external class as source, first make any class from the actual package as source, and then move the source for the external class.
- Still working on the better way to integrate new models.
